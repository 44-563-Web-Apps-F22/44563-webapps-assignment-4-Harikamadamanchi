    <h4>Scene.—Palace Yard, Westminster. Westminster Hall, L. Clock
        tower up, R.C. Private Willis discovered on sentry, R. Moonlight.</h4>
    <h6 class="QUEEN name">
        QUEEN.</h6>
    <p class="SPEECH">Oh, shame—shame upon you! Is this your fidelity to
        the laws you are bound to obey? Know ye not that it is death to
        marry a mortal?</p>
    <h6 class="LEILA name">
        LEILA.</h6>
    <p class="SPEECH">Yes, but it's not death to wish to marry a mortal!</p>
    <h6 class="FLETA name">
        FLETA.</h6>
    <p class="SPEECH">If it were, you'd have to execute us all!</p>
    <h6 class="QUEEN name">
        QUEEN.</h6>
    <p class="SPEECH">Oh, this is weakness! Subdue it!</p>
    <h6 class="CELIA name">
        CELIA.</h6>
    <p class="SPEECH">We know it's weakness, but the weakness is so strong!</p>
    <h6 class="LEILA name">
        LEILA.</h6>
    <p class="SPEECH">We are not all as tough as you are!</p>
    <h6 class="QUEEN name">
        QUEEN.</h6>
    <p class="SPEECH">Tough! D o you suppose that I am insensible to the
        effect of manly beauty? Look at that man! (Referring to Sentry.)
        A perfect picture! (To Sentry.) Who are you, sir?</p>
    <h6 class="QUEEN name">
        QUEEN. </h6>
    <p class="SPEECH">You're a very fine fellow, sir.</p>
    <h6 class="WILLIS name">
        WILLIS.</h6>
    <p class="SPEECH">I am generally admired.</p>
    <h6 class="QUEEN name">
        QUEEN.
    </h6>
    <p class="SPEECH">I can quite understand it. (To Fairies.) Now here is
        a man whose physical attributes are simply godlike. That man has
        a most extraordinary effect upon me. If I yielded to a natural
        impulse, I should fall down and worship that man. But I mortify
        this inclination; I wrestle with it, and it lies beneath my feet!
        That is how I treat my regard for that man!
